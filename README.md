This package contains an array of macros that enable [JLL packages](https://juliapackaging.github.io/BinaryBuilder.jl/stable/jll/) to generate themselves.  It is not intended to be used by users, but rather is used in autogenerated packages via [`BinaryBuilder.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder.jl).
